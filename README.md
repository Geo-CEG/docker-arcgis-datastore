Data store types - choose one

Relational
	Required data store type for ArcGIS Enterprise, used by
	hosted feature layers, spatial analysis tools, and Insights
	for ArcGIS

Tile Cache

On my first attempt to connect to the server I got this error:
"Attempt to configure data store failed.. Extended error message: The
specified GIS Server site already has a managed data store."
 
I had to open the ArcGIS Server Manager (on port 6443)
go to "Site" tab
select "Data Store" in the sidebar
and select and delete the data store there
